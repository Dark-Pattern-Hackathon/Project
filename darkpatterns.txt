IndiGo manipulating emotions of users when booking flights to opt for travel insurance.Came across this “confirmshaming” dark pattern in the Indigo app when I was booking a flight. That’s when it “present users with opt-out labels that are worded in a derogatory or belittling manner, making users feel bad about choosing not to engage with the offered service”

Google Workspace forcing users to sign up for the expensive free trial before downgrading to cheaper options

Stripe makes it impossible for users to know its monthly costs leading users to pay more
Stripe is a great product but also employs a massive dark pattern. It's almost impossible to know how much you pay monthly to use Stripe. There are bunch of reports you can try to download to analyze fees, but as you turn on their additional services (Revenue Recognition, Sigma, etc) it's basically impossible to see a breakdown of what you're paying. If people easily saw what they paid Stripe monthly (spoiler alert, it's a lot), I bet Stripe would have more competitors.

Windows 10 with keeps nagging for the user to "finish setting up the PC"
@windows 10 with another @darkpatterns where it keeps nagging for the user to "finish setting up the PC" when it's more than set up intentionally without an on line account and the screen does NOT have a choice to "not ask this again". Instead it makes you click "remind me later" as if you wanted to be nagged again. Can we stop this, @Microsoft ? It's condescending!


D2C startup Hangly where Cancellations can only be processed after the 2nd transaction of your subscription plan
@hangly: your cancellation policy is downright evil. Seriously, couldn't your UX team find any smaller font for that gotcha in your cancellation terms?

Stay informed with IMDb notifications - 'Update Now' and 'Later Options'

Adobe's subscription model deploys recurring annual plans or termination with massive penalty
Adobe is running the exact same dark pattern, even now. It's just too much free money, at the expense of people who think $54.99/month means $54.99/month, and not "commit to an annual plan and pay 12x$54.99/month (or terminate for a massive penalty)." This should not be legal.

Meta (Facebook / Instagram) to move to a "Pay for your Rights" approach
"Fundamental rights cannot be for sale. Are we going to pay for the right to vote or the right to free speech next? This would mean that only the rich can enjoy these rights, at a time when many people are struggling to make ends meet. Introducing this idea in the area of your right to data protection is a major shift. We would fight this up and down the courts" - @maxschrems for @NOYBeu


How Adobe tricks users into a 12 month contract.
The total annual cost was hidden. The 50% cancellation free was hidden. The clickwrap agreement text was much smaller than the sales text (e.g. "£0.00", "Start free trial"). The cancellation terms were hard to find. Should this be permitted?

Samsung employs the trick wording and misdirection to trick users into subscribing to news and offers.
"Wow, solid dark pattern here by Samsung: the option on the bottom —reminiscent of a regular “I have read this” prompt— auto-checks the marketing box as well. This is why people don’t trust brands. Don’t do this to your customers the moment they sign up. All potential trust lost."

TikTok is testing a feature that involves influencers engaging with a brand seemingly advertising it, but where instead of money, they receive ‘free views’.
Unlike platform ads (contracts between brands-platforms), native ads often have off-platform supply chains. While platforming the latter might be a transparency gain (esp under DSA registration), here TikTok is just playing with performance indicators. The medium is the message

Shining a Light on Dark Patterns
"This article provides the first public evidence of the power of dark patterns. It discusses the results of the authors’ large-scale experiment in which a representative sample of American consumers were randomly assigned to a control group, a group that was exposed to mild dark patterns, or a group that was exposed to aggressive dark patterns. All groups were told they had been automatically enrolled in an identity theft protection plan, and the experimental manipulation varied what acts were necessary for consumers to decline the plan. Users in the mild dark pattern condition were more than twice as likely to remain enrolled as those assigned to the control group, and users in the aggressive dark pattern condition were almost four times as likely to remain enrolled in the program."
